# words-counter
This program counts how many words are in the string.

Objective: Write a C program that counts the number of words in a given text input.

Input: The program should prompt the user to enter a string of text (maximum length of 1000 characters).

Processing:
Define a function countWords that takes a string as input and returns the number of words in it.
Iterate over each character in the input string, and count the number of spaces to determine the number of words. Consider consecutive spaces as a single delimiter between words.

Output: Display the number of words in the input text.

Additional Features (Optional):
Implement error handling to check for invalid inputs (e.g., empty string).
Handle special cases such as words separated by punctuation marks or newline characters.
Provide an option to input text from a text file instead of the console.
